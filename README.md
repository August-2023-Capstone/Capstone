## What it is

For our Capstone final project we chose to create a gaming social application utilizing our full-stack web development skills in an agile fashion in two weeks' time.
This application is designed to provide gamers with a platform to connect, communicate, and game together. Whether you're looking for new friends to play with, organizing gaming sessions, or simply chatting about your favorite games, our app has you covered.

Upon account creation, users will be prompted with the following form after navigating to their profile page to complete profile set up. This form allows the user to choose their avatar, timezone, gaming platforms, and custom gamertag.
Now the user is ready to explore games and find friends!

This is an example profile page demonstrating games that have been added to a list of favorites, as well as friends. We implemented friend requests that can be accepted or denied, as well as an option to remove games from the favorites list and update their profile information as needed.
Now the user is ready to collaborate with new friends!
