## What it is
For our Capstone final project we chose to create a gaming social application utilizing our full-stack web development skills in an agile fashion in two weeks' time.
This application is designed to provide gamers with a platform to connect, communicate, and game together. Whether you're looking for new friends to play with, organizing gaming sessions, or simply chatting about your favorite games, our app has you covered.

This is an example profile page upon the completion of adding games to favorites as well as friends. We implemented friend requests that can be accepted or denied, as well as a remove game from favorites option to allow the user to update their profile as needed.
Now the user is ready to collaborate with new friends!
